Tool to move backup data into a DB

From Kevin
Backbone has the ability to parse existing structures and turn them into other, new structures: 
http://backbonejs.org/#Collection-parse

parsecollection.parse(response, options) 
parse is called by Backbone whenever a collection's models are returned by the server, in fetch. The function is passed the raw response object, and should return the array of model attributes to be added to the collection. The default implementation is a no-op, simply passing through the JSON response. Override this if you need to work with a preexisting API, or better namespace your responses.

var Tweets = Backbone.Collection.extend({
  // The Twitter Search API returns tweets under "results".
  parse: function(response) {
    return response.results;
  }
});
